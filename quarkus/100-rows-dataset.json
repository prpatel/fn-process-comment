THis is a newer hotel, but there is no service elevator. I was continually surprised after waiting for an elevator at how many stops we made for housekeeping to enter with carts, room service carts and trays, etc. How could Hyatt skip a service elevator on this new property? It really stinks at times.....its bad.\nLastly, i have traveled with world and certainly know NYC pricing. Breakfast at the Andaz ranks above almost anything i have ever paid. Apparently, i had a $190.00 breakfast for two the first morning, and $175.00 the second. Eggs for each, coffee, berries. Wow. Of course, i really don't know...as there is no bill. They just deliver it, and leave. Prices are listed in the in-suite menu, but no itemized billing is given. I am 'gifted' with a $75.00 credit for my breakfast as a Diamond member, and i assumed that had not been applied when my bill reflected a 'non itemized' charge for $110 plus for the first night, and slightly less for the second. I was wrong, it had been applied (no way for me to see this). WOW. It certainly isn't worth it.\nI know i sound like one of those guys who complains about pricing, but clearly doesn't know what things cost. Wrong. This one really surprised me, and i have traveled the world for more than 20 years staying in some of the finest hotels in the world.

Viand diner downstairs was OK for dinner -- not great but sufficient. Friendly front desk folks were really helpful -- have breakfast at Bagel Talk not too far away. Very convenient to American Museum of Natural History -- easy to catch a cab or subway.

Went with my adult daughter and we stayed in a corner room with two twin beds on the ninth floor. It's tough to find good hotels with two beds in a room in NYC so this was a bonus. The room was very quiet. I could not hear anyone from other rooms, the hallway or any street noise. The room has a sleek modern design and was spacious for NYC standards. I loved the bathroom. Being able to get a cold bottle of water at all times was great and snacks in the rooms was a nice touch.\nI also loved the overall vibe of the hotel; small, hip, clean, and friendly. Great artwork. Not warm and cozy though. The seating in the \"lobby\" is not particularly comfortable or inviting. The staff was young and not as experienced as one would find at a five-star hotel but this is not a five-star hotel. They did the best they could to help with restaurant reservations, shopping information and other general information. Easy walk from here to Grand Central Station to hop the subway and cabs easy to find. Loved being across from The New York Pubic Library and Bryant Park. Lovely pop-up stores and ice skating in Bryant Park for the holidays. Beats the craziness of Rockefeller Center in my book. \nThere are a few problems that I believe can be corrected easily. One is the lack of proper lighting in the room, the architect and designers clearly were not thinking of women when they designed the rooms. It is very dark and would be really difficult if you were trying to get ready for a special event. Also there is no drawer space and the closet is minuscule. Not sure how to correct that issue. The other problem is that the beds, at least the twins we slept in, were not very comfortable. Very firm which is fine if you like it that way.

For some reason it was just a better experience than the restaurant.\n* Do use the concierge for tickets, restaurant and visitor recommendations. Everything they suggested worked perfectly and they enhanced our stay hugely.\n* Don't be afraid to walk and when I say walk I mean stroll. Take your time, look around and you'll be surprised how easy it is to get to places on foot. Empire State Building is insanely close by, Madison Square Garden a short walk beyond that. Rockerfeller Center, Broadway and Times Square make an easy and fun circular route and you can stroll up 5th Avenue to Central Park and beyond quite easily.\n* Subways are a nightmare to find if you're used to the clear signposting in London or Paris but once you done it once or twice you'll get the hang of it. The Setai is no more than a block or two in any direction from the subway.\n* Taxis are a law unto themselves.

A stranger did it for me! Once checked in, an employee decided to show me to the room with me trailing along with my luggage and holding the door to the elevator for him. I finally told him to take the luggage. Once in the room I was told that I was not allowed to adjust the temperature of the room on the thermostat. When I asked about the window heating/AC unit, he proceeded to fiddle with it. I told him to be sure that it was off. He lied and said it was off. It was not off. I later had to get the engineer to turn it completely off as the prior employee had activated a timer that was cycling it on and off. There is no lighting in the closet or for that whole end of the room where I was attempting to unpack. I took the minimum out of my bag for fear of losing the other things in the dark. All wall plugs are completely filled with the hotel's stuff. I had to get down on my hands and knees to find a strip plug underneath the desk for my IPad to charge. Then I found an outlet on the side of the desk for my IPhone to charge. However, to my dismay the next morning I found that when I turned off the desk light, the desk plug also went dead and my phone did NOT charge overnight. The mattress was good and that is why this hotel received three stars instead of two. Now, the shower: I scalded my right arm turning off the shower because there are absolutely NO markings on the shower as where hot, cold or off is. I recommend that you step outside the tub/shower before turning it off and be sure not to have any part of you under the water when turning it off. There is no ventilation in the bathroom. Therefore, not only was the bathroom completely steamed, which ruined my hair, but also the bedroom windows. As to the so-called BAY window in my room: The top half of the windows is completely blacked out by the hotel eliminating half the light coming in the windows. And this room really needs more light. In addition, there are dark brown wooden shutters that cannot be lifted, only tilted that further curtail light entering this room. What a dismal swamp it is. Breakfast: there was an argument about whether or not I was allowed to order the continental breakfast, being first told no and later told yes. And then there was the issue with the eggs. Even when I told them how many minutes to boil the eggs, the cook could not do the eggs even half way cooked to wear I asked. Not a good situation, in my opinion. Sleeping: Although the mattress was comfortable, I had to wear earplugs and play a sound soother to sleep well. When the neighboring room turned on its shower, the water sound screamed and bubbled right at the headboard to my bed. I checked out in the AM for a conference, stored my luggage at the hotel and was allowed to use the gym in the late PM to change my shoes for my trip home in the early evening. I am attempting to be fair and point out the good, too. And finally, when I noted some of the deficiencies to the person who originally escorted me to my room his answer was: \"It is What it is.\" Now that I am safely at home, I can laugh at this most ridiculous interpretation of customer service I have ever heard.", "author": {"username": "9Adventuress", "num_cities": 9, "num_helpful_votes": 26, "num_reviews": 20, "num_type_reviews": 13, "id": "212787FEB4E7A223D38277943BCA6E55", "location": "Cockeysville, Maryland"}, "date_stayed": "December 2012", "offering_id": 93396, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "December 7, 2012", "id": 146977843, "via_mobile": false}

They recognized us each time we walked in and out, which made things really great.

Ours had 2 queen beds and not much room for anything else. The one negative was that it was rather dimly lit even when we turned on every last light, but from what I understand this is a green hotel and they are saving on energy and wattage. However, we would have liked to have the room a bit brighter since there was also a lot of woodwork and dark closet doors which also made the room on the dark side even during the day. The beds were extremely comfortable with nice white fluffy duvet comforters and down pillows. There were a lot of outlets and close to the bed (and located on the nightstands) which were great for charging phones and computers.\nWe were on a high floor with nice views. The rooms with two beds don't face the empire state building, which was a bummer because we hoped to see it from the windows.

Our suite, #1000, had the most amazing view of Rockefeller Centre. Also, the windows open nice and wide, which was good because the hotel has that stuffy old hotel air, which gives it its charm but also makes it hard to sleep at night. Of course opening the window makes it louder than normal; I brought earplugs.

When your on a quick 4 day'er, you don't spend any time in it anyway. It had a TV, dresser draws, a little fridge, a good sized bathtub shower and a desk with chair. Pretty standard. \nUnfortunately, we did not eat in the hotel restaurant but a lady in the elevator told me that it was great. Within a 5 block radius there are plenty of restaurants and Irish Pubs (which happen to be my favourite!), so the hotel ammendities were not that important to me on this trip. There is a good, reasonably priced, family style restaurant at the end of the block called \"the red flame\". Great breakfast diner restaurant for it's price. \nAs I mentioned, the hotel is close to everything. Don't kid yourself though, if you are in New York to see the sights, you will be walking alot.

And the reality two non sparkling bottles of water. If I wanted to have some coke it was necessary to use room service. It was not overpriced but still very annoying. And the promise given has not been fulfilled.\nThe other negative aspect was that we were not provided with advantages as LHW members except for thenice personal letter from the manager. Usually we receive at least some fruits, uograde, free internet or something...\nThe last negative point was about pre arrival assistance and concierge. We sent some requirements before our arrival but got answer only very late as our email was categorized as spam and the concierge had not chcecked the spam folder. We also had some difficulties with our reservation when in the city and were not able to reach the concierge via phone. We succeeded only after 15 minutes and sixth call. \nOne great tip about the hotel: no checkout time limit. Pretty good!\nDespite small negative issues we very much enjoyed the stay and can honestly recommend the hotel to others.", "author": {"username": "CzechTourist", "num_cities": 23, "num_helpful_votes": 19, "num_reviews": 27, "num_type_reviews": 23, "id": "93204D751F8796489DB9807AE98C2979", "location": "Prague, the Czech Republic"}, "date_stayed": "October 2012", "offering_id": 1776857, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "December 4, 2012", "id": 146744546, "via_mobile": false}

We stayed an unfortunate four nights at this hotel, and suffered major itching, including a major let down from what we were advised BEFORE booking at The Chatwal! We phoned prior to booking to ensure that the hotel had bathtubs (as our personal preference, we only book with hotels which have bathtubs) - we were advised that EVERY room has a bathtub - excellent, so we booked. We arrived all the way from New Zealand (19 hours of flight-time) at approximately 11:00pm to arrive to a major disappointment. NO BATHTUB! We phoned the desk from our room and were advised \"sorry, there's nothing we can do as all rooms with a bathtub are taken\". We then advised that prior to booking we were advised that ALL ROOMS have a bathtub - \"no sorry, you were told wrong, and there's nothing I can do but you are welcome to leave\". Then my husband went downstairs and spoke to the \"duty manager\" who then finally relented and looked up to see who would be checking out the following morning so we could get a room with a bathtub. We were then promised a room with a bathtub by 12:00 midday, but by the next morning, the woman at the desk advised \"sorry, but they are now checking out at 4:00pm\", so we asked for a refund for the first day since the whole inconvenience had ruined a whole entire travel day (WE had been trying to sort out this mess OURSELVES all night long and the following morning by arranging a room with a bathtub) - their reply \"sorry, there's nothing I can do\" - she didn't even offer any complimentary gestures as a way of saying sorry for the inconvenience caused by this ridiculous hotel! We would have loved to have checked out and moved to another hotel, however, upon such short notice and only arranging three days in New York, time was very restricted. This hotel is PERFECT FOR BACKPACKERS WHO HAVE MONEY! The hotel is so small and running on a strictly cheap budget that there is no doorman in the morning upon check-out.

When getting out of the taxi, we had our bags taken care of right away and directed towards the check in counter. We had no problems at check in, and received a complimentary room upgrade which was a pleasant surprise.

Leather closet doors that looked like trunks, an excellent bar area, and a comfortable big bed. The bathroom is amazing. While there was no bathtub, the shower made up for it as it was very large, and the toilet was quite neat with all these japanese style options. The amenities provided were also excellent.\nWe also used the butler service to have our shoes shined, and clothes pressed before dinner.\nHad a chance to use the pool, and gym facilities, which were adequate, but they were working with the space they had.\nThe location was very close to Times Square, so that was convenient, but isolated so the noise and traffic would not affect your stay.\nOur four night stay was quite pleasant, however you get what you pay for, and the Chatwal is pricey.

We used our Starwood points for the room. Little pricey, but it's a nifty hotel. The lobby area is small, but with gorgeous Art Deco. Interior of The Lambs Club restaurant is also really lovely. It's right off Times Square, so location is good for most things.\nRooms at the Chatwal aren't super big, but this is NYC and this is a retro location, so I didn't expect massive space. What they lack in size, they make up for in appointments. The rooms are done up kind of like I'd imagine a 1920s cruise ship. Leather doors with leather handles, kind of like old time steamer trunks. Lots of cubbies and efficient use of space. Cool bar. Bathrooms are awesome. As others have mentioned, the toilets have an unreal number of functions--bidet, seat warmer, air dry. Too many functions, really, but fun when you're on vacation.\nOur room was facing the alley, so nothing great on the view. But the room was nice enough that it didn't matter. Wish the bed had been a bit more comfy and higher off the floor--all the beds seemed very, very low--but overall I was pretty happy with the space. Service was great as well. Free shoe shine and you have a butler who can handle things like pressing your suit or dress for dinner.\nDid have a bad situation, which highlights the excellence of the service. We'd been given a room with a connecting door. Unfortunately, next door were three single guys having a weekend in the city and the noise was unreal. Like they were standing right next to you talking in your ear while you were trying to sleep. So we got to participate when they got room service at 2 a.m. when they got up at 8:30 and then again when the maids came in to clean at 9. After the first night, we complained to the desk and they gave us a new room.\nWe went out for the day and when we came back, they'd packed all of our things and moved them for us. And they were thorough--they even found the charger my husband had left plugged into the wall. So have to give them credit for the assist.\nThat said, if you walk into your room and there's a connecting door and you're not with the people staying in the next room, immediately get a new one. You will hear everything.\nOverall I enjoyed it. Honestly, I was probably expecting a little more for the level, so I wouldn't say it exceeded my expectations, but it was very nice. My gold status didn't really get us much of anything, so can't say Starwood helped much, other than to use the points. It's not inexpensive. It was 30,000 points plus per night, and more than $700 if we'd paid out of pocket. Not out of sync for this level in NYC, but the St. Regis was on the same point level and I can't say I think it's better than that. \nBottom line--if you're looking for something retro and cool, it's great. If you need something more modern or a lot of space, probably not for you.", "author": {"username": "dagnyt", "num_cities": 10, "num_helpful_votes": 43, "num_reviews": 15, "num_type_reviews": 12, "id": "2460DAC350A498A3DB494E1FE485F32C", "location": "Tallahassee, Florida"}, "date_stayed": "November 2012", "offering_id": 1641016, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "November 20, 2012", "id": 145838274, "via_mobile": false}

We stayed in a two bedroom suite with views of the library, Bryant Park, Empire State Building, and a glimpse of Times Square. The location was superb. We were within walking distance to my favorite NYC places including Ktown, Central Park, and 5th Ave. \nOur suite was HUGE especially for NYC. The bathrooms are sleek with C.O. Bigelow toiletries. There was a kitchenette incluing a mini dishwasher. All non-alcoholic drinks were included in the room rate. Since my husband is Hyatt diamond, breakfast for all four adults was included in the rate and we were able to have it delivered to our suite through room service. The breakfast came from the restaurant downstairs - the shop and everything was delicious. \nThe hotel is trendy and modern and yet it feels cozy.

Unfortunately, the rooms are uncomfortably furnished and almost useless to work or read in. The furnishings (chairs and desk) are at a level about 4 inches below normal. There is no comfortable chair or sofa on which to sit; when in your room, only the bed offers any true respite. Televisions are wall mounted flat screens, but set only about four feet off the ground, so unless you are in bed, an adult generally would look down to the screen. All in all, very strange and completely unnecessary.

We booked the 1 bedroom, 2 double bed room. The room was HUGE, very clean and we had a great view. Our room had a coffee machine, which was re-stocked with coffee pods and creamer every day by the cleaning staff. There is also a great restaurant next door, the owner was very nice and makes an effort to greet his customers (and remembers the ones who go back multiple times like us!). \nMy only complaints:\n1. (I don't know if this was an issue with our room only) - The bathroom didn't have any sort of ventilation, so we had to shower with the door open or the whole room would steam up. This wasn't a problem for us and wouldn't really be a problem for a couple, but could get awkward if you were staying with your boss on a business trip!\n2. No complimentary wireless internet - For the amount of money we paid, it would have been nice to have access to wifi, even if we had to sit in the lobby or something to get it. They have the option of around $10 per day to get wireless in the room, or you could go to the computer room which only had 2 computers in it (and it was always full). \nOverall - A great hotel. The staff were extremely friendly (especially the door men, who would happily stand and have a chat while we were waiting for a taxi), the room was lovely and it's in a great spot (walking distance to Times Square or easy access to the subway for those who don't want to walk).
